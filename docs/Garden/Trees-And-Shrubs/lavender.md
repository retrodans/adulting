title: "Lavender"
---

- Location: Opposite shed, by summer house, by kitchen window clematis

## Maintenance

- When to prune: late summer (September)
- How to Prune: Remove any spent flower stalks and about 2.5cm (1in) of leaf growth. Foliage can be clipped over in spring if growth is untidy or frost damaged. Lavender does not break new growth easily from old stems so don't cut back into the woody stems.
- Mulch: ???

## Older plants

Replace them

> Even if pruned annually, older lavender plants can become straggly, very woody and mis-shapen so, as they are fast growing and establish quickly, they are best replaced if you want to keep everything looking neat.
