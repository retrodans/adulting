title: "Smoky Tree"
---

- Location: Centre island of the garden

## Maintenance

- Desired height: `tbc`
- When to prune: late winter or very early spring (Feb)
- How to Prune: Cut cleanly at a slight angle Â¼-inch (0.5 cm.) outside the branch collar. (The branch collar is the swelling in the parent branch from which the secondary branch grew). Cutting this way prevents cutting into the parent wood and introducing pathogens.
- Mulch: No

## Troubleshooting

### Dead branches

Possibly caused when pruning, make sure you do not prune tips, always cut back for just before a growth node or branch collar.  Also ensure tools are sharpened and clean.
